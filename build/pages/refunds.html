        Sweet & Simpke Cupcakery Refund Policy
      </h1>
      <p class="font-bodyText">
        We take a lot of pride in all our products.
        <strong class="underline">All sales are final</strong> , with the
        exception of custom orders cancelled with sufficient notice.
       </p>
       <p class="font-bodyText my-5">
        Partial or full refunds are decided on a case-by-case basis, but please
        note that we do not provide refunds in cases where an item was prepared
        correctly but a flavor or texture did not meet a personal preference. ·
        Due to the tedious, handcrafted nature of our products, we are unable to
        provide refunds or exchanges for most orders · Once you or a designated
        party has picked up an order and left the premise, it is considered
        "accepted" – we will ask to make sure that everything is correct such as
        the design, etc. Refunds requested due to decorating style, color shade,
        or general design will not be honored after leaving with your cake. ·
        All products are the responsibility of the customer once it leaves our
        shop. We are not responsible for any damage occurring to the cake during
        transport, set-up or any time thereafter. Keep in mind that cakes are
        very fragile and damages can happen if not handled properly – such as
        cracks, smudges, melted frosting, etc. · Any orders that are prepaid and
        are not picked up the day it was scheduled will NOT be refunded. If we
        give you a refund, you CANNOT keep the cake. You can only get the refund
        if you refuse to “accept” the cake. We will NOT negotiate a partial
        refund if you keep the cake. This is a “take it, or leave it” policy. We
        are not responsible for any expense you may incur for replacing your
        cake.
